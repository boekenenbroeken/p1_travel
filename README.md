## Technologies used

- React
- React Router
- Typescript
- Redux toolkit
- React Hook Form
- Yup
- Axios
- Mantine (core and notifications library)
- Jest
- React testing library

Although it would have been possible to reduce the number of packages used, I decided to adhere to the "preexisting" conditions for the assignment.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/boekenenbroeken/p1_travel.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd p1_travel`
3. To run the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend` and run: `npm run start`
4. To run the server, navigate to the server directory: `cd api` and run: `npm run dev`

By following these steps, you will be able to run the frontend and server locally on your machine.
